# Who am I, anyways?

I'm Jay, a college graduate and self-motivated problem solver. I enjoy seeing what issues exist with tools and seek to fix them by boiling the problems down into their most basic form. I have experience in multiple languages such as Python, C, Java, JavaScript as well as frameworks like SpringBoot and React.JS! I'd love to have a conversation on just about anything tech-related or adjacent, so if you'd like to chat go ahead and [message me on LinkedIn!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jay-sakabu-b78a04136/)
